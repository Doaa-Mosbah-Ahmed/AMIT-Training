What is Abstraction in Python?

Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.

Importance:                   

         Abstraction provides a programmer to hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase the efficiency of the program. Now, we can start learning how we can achieve abstraction using the Python program.
         
         
 What is Encapsulation in Python?

   Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. This lesson will cover what encapsulation is and how to implement it in Python.
 
 
 Advantages of Encapsulation
     1-Security.
      2-Data Hiding. 
       3-Simplicity. 
        4-Aesthetics.
